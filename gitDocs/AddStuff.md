# This is a file about adding stuff to the gitTuttorial Text File #

I should create alias or bash functions to handle git commands so that I don't have to type all the git commands.

git push origin master -> big g push to m

git add .
git commit -m "<descriptive text here>"
git push origin master

->

big g push the code  "<descriptive text here>"

### Its not really about writing less words, even though it could be for that, its about making it easier to tell the terminal to do stuff in more easier terms. ###

### It can also me used as company lingo, to make it easier for people to work together and push code, when you have your company ###

#### But it also has its down sides when people start forgetting how to use the real git commands and only remember how to use their commands lol ####
