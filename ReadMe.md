## Welcome to the Official ReadMe for "TheDocs"

---

This is a repo for remembering key commands and rules for different programming frameworks and tools.
This repo is not for everyone and is somewhat personalized for my experince but some people may still find it useful.
It is still a big work in progress so keep that in mind and continue at your own risk. The most focused on docs in this repo is currently
the gitDocs, it does not have all the info you will need but enough to get started. ... I hope lol.
