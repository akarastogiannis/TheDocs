# Express Js Docs

## Starting a Project
1. Make a dir
2. Run ` npm init `
	> **Note**: Follow the steps of npm init, you can leave everything the same or blank.
4. Run `install express`
5. Run `install nodemon`
	> **Note:** This is to auto restart server after every save.
	> This is **Optional** 
7. In Package.json under **scripts** under **test** type `"start":  "node <nameOfServer>.js"`
	> **Note:** This is so that you can use `npm start` when you need to run the server instead of typing the server name each time.
	> This is **Optional**.
8. Then under **main** add `"type":  "module",` 
	> **Note:** This is so that you can use `import` in express
	> This is **Optional**.
